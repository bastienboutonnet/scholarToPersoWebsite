# scholarToPersoWebsite
In Progress, please bear with me.

## Todo
- finish tutorial
- make package 'visualiseScholar'    
    This package will request `scholar` and put several visualisation themes around `ggplot`
 - find out how to reproduce the "heatmap" style. Probably corr coef with a dummy X axis so as to generate a tile plot where X is "muted".
- Might be a cool idea to also see about generating a graph like you would in Python using Bokeh to insert in the website directly, rather than embeding an image. Much cooler!
 - Bokeh, insert graph in HTML: http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/0.10.0/docs/user_guide/embed.html
 - ggplot plotly stuff: http://ouzor.github.io/blog/2014/11/21/interactive-visualizations.html
 - ggvis: http://ggvis.rstudio.com/
 - embed bokeh into django templates: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/29508958/how-to-embed-bokeh-graphs-into-django-templates-without-using-the-bokeh-server
- For a more distant future maybe develop a python package to do the equivalent of `scholar`?
- Also for a distant future: A buienrada app for the pebble? There is already one but would be interesting to figure out how to reproduce it since the code is not open-source... Which sucks!
- Buienradar, said they'd soon implement a querryable location based feed for current conditions based on lon/lat coordinates (not for commercial use).
