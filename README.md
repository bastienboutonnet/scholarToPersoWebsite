# scholarToPersoWebsite
In Progress, please bear with me.

## Todo
- finish tutorial
- make package 'visualiseScholar'    
    This package will request `scholar` and put several visualisation themes around `ggplot`
 - find out how to reproduce the "heatmap" style. Probably corr coef with a dummy X axis so as to generate a tile plot where X is "muted".
- Might be a cool idea to also see about generating a graph like you would in Python using Bokeh to insert in the website directly, rather than embeding an image. Much cooler!
- For a more distant future maybe develop a python package to do the equivalent of `scholar`?
