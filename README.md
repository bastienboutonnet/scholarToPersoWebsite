# scholarToPersoWebsite
In Progress

## Todo
- finish tutorial
- make package 'visualiseScholar'
    This package will request `scholar` and put several visualisation themes around `ggplot`
 - find out how to reproduce the "heatmap" style. Probably corr coef with a dummy X axis so as to generate a tile plot where X is "muted".
